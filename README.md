# Invoice-Generator
This was a project in my CS265 (Advanced Programming Techniques) course. 

The C program reads an order file with item, quantity, unit cost, and state for taxing. It also reads a file which lists the tax rates for all the states. The C program generates an invoice with the proper costs for each item with quantity and tax added. The program then generates an invoice file with the cost breakdown and grand total.
